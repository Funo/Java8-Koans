Java8-Koans
===========

A set of Java 8 Koans to teach you the basics of some of the new features
Java 8 has to offer. It won't go into too much depth, but it will give you 
some basic feeling on how the new feature will make your code faster and easier to write and simply better.

##Prerequisites
As this is a Java 8 - "Koan styled" - series of small tutorials, the only thing you actually need for this tutorial is the Java 8 JDK.
